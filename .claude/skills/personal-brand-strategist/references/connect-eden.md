# Connecting Eden, and handling limits

What to do when the Eden tools are missing, the connection breaks, or the user runs out of credits. Never just point at a marketing page; walk the user through the fix right here in chat.

## No `eden_*` tools available

The user hasn't connected the Eden MCP yet. Give them the exact steps for where they're running you, then have them say "build my personal brand strategy" again once connected.

**First:** if they don't have an Eden account, they need one (free to start): https://app.eden.so

**claude.ai or Claude Desktop** — give them this link and these steps:

1. Open: https://claude.ai/customize/connectors?modal=add-custom-connector&connectorName=Eden&connectorUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmcp.eden.so%2Fmcp
   (It opens Claude's connector settings with Eden pre-filled. They just click Add.)
2. Sign in with their Eden account when the small window appears, and approve.
3. Back in the chat: click the tools / connectors icon in the message box and switch Eden on.
4. Say "build my personal brand strategy" again.

Alternative path: in Eden itself, Settings, then Integrations, then "Add to Claude". Same result.

**Claude Code** — run:

```
claude mcp add --transport http eden https://mcp.eden.so/mcp
```

Then `/mcp` to sign in to Eden, and re-run the workflow.

**Any other MCP client** — add a custom MCP server: URL `https://mcp.eden.so/mcp`, transport Streamable HTTP, auth OAuth. Sign in with their Eden account.

## Tools exist but calls fail with auth errors

Errors like "OAuth authorization required", "Unauthorized", "auth-expired", or a session error mean the connection went stale (this happens after server restarts). The fix is to reconnect, not to retry:

- claude.ai / Desktop: Settings, Connectors, find Eden, reconnect or re-authenticate. Then re-run.
- Claude Code: `/mcp` and re-authenticate Eden.

Tell the user plainly: "The Eden connection expired. Reconnect it and say build my personal brand strategy; I'll pick up where we left off."

## Out of credits mid-run

Eden research tools spend credits from the user's Eden plan. When they run out, the tool returns a structured error instead of results:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "status": "out_of_credits",
  "message": "...",
  "upgradeRequired": true,
  "upgradeUrl": "..."
}
```

When you see `status: "out_of_credits"`:

1. **Stop making research calls immediately.** Retrying spends nothing and returns the same error.
2. **Write the strategy from what you already have.** The interview alone supports every section except the receipts; label What's Already Working and the swipe file as partial in one honest line.
3. **Give the user the way out, once, without nagging.** Use the `upgradeUrl` from the error payload as the link. One line: "To get the full research pass, add credits or upgrade here: <upgradeUrl>." If the payload has no link, use https://app.eden.so/?settings=billing
4. Still save the strategy and interview notes to the Eden board if note writes are working.

Never fake research to fill the gap, and never end the run with only an error message. The user should always get the best strategy the remaining data supports, plus one clear line about what happened and the link.

## Any other tool failure

Read the structured error. `invalid` means fix your input and don't retry the same call. `unreachable` means retry once. Anything else: note it in one line ("couldn't check X this run") and keep going. One broken call never cancels the strategy.
